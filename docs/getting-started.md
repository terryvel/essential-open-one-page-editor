# Getting Started

1. Open an editor in your browser:
   - Value Streams: `editors/value-stream-editor-en-standalone.html`
   - Strategic Summary (Drivers/Goals/Objectives/Plans): `editors/strategic-summary-editor-en-standalone.html`
2. Fill in the data for the selected editor:
   - Value Streams: Summary and Canvas tabs
   - Strategic Summary: Drivers, Goals, Objectives (SMART), and Strategic Plans
3. Use **Import JSON** / **Export JSON** to iterate locally. Sample files are in `examples/`:
   - `examples/value-stream-template.json`
   - `examples/strategic-summary-template.json`
4. Generate the **.dup** and import it into Essential (Open Source, Docker, or Cloud).
